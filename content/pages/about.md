# Digital Twin over Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that allows you to provision computing resources, orchestrate them, visualize their status in large dashboards, and keep them simple and manageable at all times. It is also a very friendly platform that can handle numerous applications in small containers in a very delicate and elegant way.

Our saga is heading toward our next destination: the “Digital Twin.” It is a technology that dataizes space and synchronizes it in real time so that SQL can be applied to the real world. So that anyone can easily manage their space and assets in a small smartphone.

Digital Twin is one of the best combinations with Kubernetes, which handles resources in the world's most sophisticated way.
